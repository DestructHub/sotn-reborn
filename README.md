# SotN Reborn
## Abstract
[![HitCount](https://hitt.herokuapp.com/ryukinix/decorating.svg)](https://github.com/ryukinix/decorating)

The project aims to build a [free](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html), cross-platform, moddable, alternative engine for [*Castlevania: Symphony of the Night*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Symphony_of_the_Night), with a high fidelity experience compared to its original.

This project does not distribut and cannot be distributed with the original game assets. To play with these assets one must have a legally obtained backup of one of the original game releases.
